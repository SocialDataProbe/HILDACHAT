# 8. DATA COLLECTION

From wave 9 the data collection task was subcontracted to Roy Morgan Research, an Australian owned market research company. This transition from Nielsen (the fieldwork provider for waves 1-8) also involved a change in the method of data collection to computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) (for further information see Watson, 2010).

### 8.1. Pilot Testing

The questionnaires are developed over the 9-month period prior to the main fieldwork for each wave. This pilot testing involves:

- Skirmish with a small number of participants (10-15 for waves 1-4 and 30 from wave 5-12) conducted in an office environment. From wave 13 only minor changes to the questionnaires have been made, therefore a skirmish has not been held.
- Dress Rehearsal with a sample of households:
- Waves 1-4 with approximately 200 in NSW;
- Waves 5-12 with approximately 700 in NSW and Victoria;
- Wave 13 onwards with 300 in Melbourne and Geelong.

In waves 1 and 2, a Pre-Test was also conducted in between the Skirmish and Dress Rehearsal with 30 Sydney households. From wave 3 onwards, the Pre-Test sample has been rolled into the Dress Rehearsal sample and in wave 5 a booster sample of 500 households was added.

### 8.2. Dependent Data

In wave 9, the introduction of the CAPI instrument also included the use of dependent data drawn from interviews at previous waves. As in previous waves, the HF displayed information from the previous wave including dates of birth, last interview date, last wave outcome and a list of sample members who had lived with the household members previously. Prior to wave 9 this information was pre-printed on the HF. From wave 9 this data are pre-loaded into the HF.
Each wave we also included extra pieces of information from the previous interview. This information was used either as proactive dependent data (which means that they are reminded of what they said at the previous interview and then given the opportunity to correct the information presented to them if they disagree with it) or to skip a sequence of questions (that we have asked in a previous wave).
Table 8.1 describes the dependant data used in the HILDA Survey.

Table 8.1: Dependent data used in the HILDA Survey

| Description | Section | Wave/s |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Whether the respondent was employed or not employed at the previous interview is confirmed with the respondent before asking about jobs held between interviews. | Section C and D | Wave 9 onwards. |
| Whether the respondent had one or more jobs is confirmed with the respondent before asking about jobs held between interviews. | Section C | Wave 9 onwards. |
| The children's first name, age, and sex including new children added to the HF are fed into Section G once confirmed with the respondent (after G1) | Section G | Wave 9 onwards. Deceased children included every 4 years from wave 11. |
| Whether respondent is a twin or triplet, or a parent of a twin or triplet is fed forward to ask if the twins or triplets are identical. If twin or triplet is under 15 years of age the parents will be asked, if 15 years or over the respondent will be asked. If answered in a previous wave, the respondent / parents will not be asked again. | Section G | Every year from wave 18. |
| The respondent's marital status and cohabitation from the previous wave interviewed is fed into H1a and the respondent then is asked if there are any changes since they were last interviewed. | Section H | Wave 9 onwards. |
| Whether the respondent has ever owned a residential property and age first acquired is fed into Section J. If the respondent has owned a residential property, then J1b and J2 will be skipped. | Section J | Every 4 years from wave 10. |
| Whether the respondent has indicated that both parents had died (asked in the History of Parent Module) is fed into HP1a; this information is used to skip questions about the respondents' parents. | Section HP | Waves 12, 15 and 19. |
| Whether a respondent has previously responded in a health module year (from wave 9) is used to skip retrospective questions on childhood health. | Section K | Every 4 years from wave 13. |
| Whether an update to Citizenship / Permanent Residence is required (every 4 years from wave 14). The target population is all persons who indicated either at wave 4 (in CPQ or NPQ) or in an NPQ in a subsequent wave that they were not an Australian citizen. | Section K | Every 4 years from wave 14. |
| Whether an update to work experience (total years spent in paid work over a lifetime) is required. These are sample members that did not respond to one or more waves after the wave first interviewed. | Section E | Wave 14 onwards. |
| Whether a respondent had spent time enrolled in a secondary school or secondary school level program in their previous interview and had not left school. This information is used to confirm whether they have now left school at CPQ A2a. All other respondents are asked CPQ A2b. | Section A | Wave 16 onwards. |
| Whether an update is required to educational history variables. If a respondent did not respond to the previous education module (every 4 years from wave 12), they are then asked questions relating to highest year of school completed and their highest post-school qualification (every 4 years from wave 16). If a respondent did respond in the previous education module and had since obtained a formal educational qualification, these respondents are asked the questions relating to their highest qualification. | Section A | Every 4 years from wave 16. |
| Whether a respondent has retired completely from the workforce in a previous wave and are 75 years or older in the current wave. If these respondents confirm they are completely retired again, they will not be asked the year they retired. | Section D | Wave 17 onwards. |

| Description | Section | Wave/s |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Whether birthweight for a child sample member was collected in a <br> previous Health Module wave. Data were fed into the Household <br> Questionnaire to filter out children where their birthweight was <br> collected in a previous wave. | Section Q | Wave 21 only. |

# 8.3. Questionnaire Length 

Table 8.2 provides the average time taken to complete each of the questionnaires each wave. The increased length of the HQ in wave 2 (and every 4 years onwards) is due to the inclusion of the wealth module. From wave 20, the SCQ was also available online.

# 8.4. Interviewers 

The number of face-to-face and phone interviewers used for each wave of the fieldwork is given in Table 8.3 together with the percentage of interviewers that were new to the HILDA Survey.
From waves 1 to 9, all interviewers and supervisors attended a two-day briefing session prior to each wave. From waves 2 to 9 , the new interviewers received an extra day of training. From wave 10, all new interviewers attended a 3-day training session and experienced interviewers receive a one-day training session. All interviewers are provided with a manual covering the details of the questionnaires and fieldwork procedures.

# 8.5. Fieldwork Process 

### 8.5.1. Data Collection Mode

Most of the data were collected though face-to-face interviews. While telephone interviews and assisted interviews were conducted to ensure a high response rate, they are only used as a last resort. Table 8.4 provides the percentage of people interviewed by telephone in each wave. Because some households moved outside of the areas originally selected across Australia and the desire to interview as many people as possible, more telephone interviews are necessary in later waves.
In wave 20 and 21, telephone was the primary mode of interviewing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing requirement imposed by the government. ${ }^{43}$ Face-toface interviewing was only conducted where state government restrictions allowed. In wave 20, 95.7 per cent, and in wave 21, 75.7 per cent, of the individual interviews were conducted by telephone.
Respondents were also asked to complete a Self-Completion Questionnaire (SCQ). In waves 1-19 a paper SCQ was used but an online version was added from wave 20. In wave 20, 82.0 per cent, and in wave 21, 71.2 per cent, of SCQs were completed online.

* A Top-Up sample was added in wave 11 and 23.


# 8.5.2. Timeline 

The interviews are conducted annually, with the interviewer briefing occurring at the end of July to mid-August each year. In wave 1, all but a few interviews were completed by December 2001. From wave 2 onwards, the fieldwork has been extended by several months into the following year to focus on tracking and interviewing hard-to-find cases. The fieldwork period for wave 11 was extended due to the addition of the Top-Up sample.
Table 8.5 provides details of the fieldwork dates and Table 8.6 shows how the individual interviews are spread across each fieldwork period.
For those interviewed in the next wave, most are interviewed within one month of the anniversary of the previous interview (as shown in Table 8.7). Approximately 4 per cent of the interviews are, however, conducted three or more months before or after the anniversary of the interview in the previous wave.

# 8.5.3. Survey Notification Material 

In wave 1, the selected households were sent a primary approach letter and a brochure approximately one week prior to when the interviewer was scheduled to contact the household. This pre-interview material marketed the survey to respondents as a study about 'Living in Australia' and, among other things, emphasised that participation was voluntary and provided a means for sample members to opt out of the survey prior to an interviewer calling.
From wave 2 onwards, a primary approach letter and newsletter were sent to the last known address of each household approximately one month prior to when the interviewer was scheduled to make contact. The newsletter provides respondents with some results

from prior waves. In addition to the posted pre-interview material, households with people who had not been part of the household in the previous wave were given a New Entrants Brochure. This brochure provided more information about the purpose of the study, why they had been asked to participate, and a method to opt out of the study if they chose to. A follow-up newsletter was introduced from wave 3 onwards.
A copy of the primary approach letters, brochures and newsletters are available from the HILDA website.

# 8.5.4. Respondent Incentives 

In waves 1 to 4 , a $\$ 50$ cash incentive was offered to households where all eligible household members completed the Person Questionnaire. If this did not occur, a $\$ 20$ payment was offered to households if at least one interview was obtained.
In waves 5 to 8 , respondents providing an individual interview received $\$ 25$ and a $\$ 25$ bonus was received by each fully responding household (i.e., each eligible member if the household provided an interview). This cash incentive structure is different to the one used in waves 1 to 4.
In wave 9, two significant changes were made to the cash incentive. First, it was provided to the respondent in cash immediately after the face-to-face interview. Second, the incentive was increased from $\$ 25$ to $\$ 30$. From wave 13 the cash incentive for the completion of an individual interview and the household bonus was increased to $\$ 35$ and in wave 19 the cash incentive for the completion of an individual interview and the household bonus increased to $\$ 40$. The availability of the incentive was made clear in both the primary approach letter and the brochure/newsletter.
In wave 20, the incentive for fully responding households was removed and instead a $\$ 20$ incentive was offered on completion of the Self-Completion Questionnaire (SCQ). The $\$ 40$ incentive for the individual interview remained. While in previous waves, the incentive was mainly provided in cash, from wave 20, non-cash options such as an EFTPOS card ${ }^{44}$, EGift, cheque or charitable donation ${ }^{45}$ were also offered.
In wave 23, the individual interview was increased to $\$ 50$ and the option to receive the incentive via bank transfer was introduced.

### 8.5.5. Call Routine, Follow-Up and Refusal Aversion

In wave 1, the fieldwork was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved the interviewer working in an area over a three-week period. They visited each selected household according to the specified call-back pattern. ${ }^{46}$ This achieved approximately 65 per cent of the interviews from each area. The remainder of each workload was then consolidated into intensive follow-up workloads and reassigned to the most experienced interviewers. They again visited each of these households according to the specified callback pattern. These interviewers obtained the remaining 35 per cent of the interviews from each area.
From wave 2 onwards, a tracking component is incorporated into the fieldwork, splitting it into three distinct periods. ${ }^{47}$ All households were issued into the field for the first period, and where all the interviews had not been completed, they were reissued into the field in the

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{44}$ An EFTPOS card option was only offered in wave 20.
    ${ }^{45}$ For the SCQ and PQ payment method variables, see Table 4.19.
    ${ }^{46}$ Six or more calls were made to all selected households until a final household outcome was achieved. These calls were made over a minimum of a five-day period, with typically three calls on weekdays and at least three calls on weekends.
    ${ }^{47}$ For details on the tracking procedures adopted, see Watson and Wooden (2004b).

next period. ${ }^{48}$ If a household could not be found at either one of these stages, they were put into tracking and once found were issued back into the current period if found quickly or more generally into a later period. The third period was used to finalise households that had to be traced and could not be immediately issued back into the field and also to contact some households where it was deemed beneficial to contact them in this period (for example, a household member may have been away from the household at earlier contacts or they may have been temporarily unwell or busy).

# 8.5.6. Foreign Language Interviews 

Language difficulties between the interviewer and the potential respondent were most often resolved by another member of the household acting as an interpreter. However, a small number of interviews each wave are conducted with a professional interpreter present during the interview (see variable _iohlp (Assistance of 3rd party)).
The Self-Completion Questionnaire is only provided in English.

### 8.5.7. Interviewer Monitoring

Several methods were used to ensure the fieldwork quality was consistent and maintained throughout the fieldwork collection period. These methods focused on the training, experience, in-field checking and monitoring of the interviewers. ${ }^{49}$

### 8.6. Response Rates

A summary of the outcomes of the wave 1 fieldwork is provided in Table 8.8 and shows that from the 11,693 households identified as in-scope, interviews were completed with all eligible members of 6,872 households and with at least one eligible member of a further 810 households. The household response rate was, therefore, 66 per cent. Wooden, Freidin and Watson (2002) provide some comparisons of this response rate to other similar studies and conclude there are good reasons to be extremely satisfied with the rate of response obtained.
The wave 1 person-level outcomes are provided in Table 8.9. Within the 7,682 households interviewed, there were 19,914 people, resulting in an average of 2.6 persons per household. Of these people 4,787 were under 15 years of age on the preceding 30 June and hence were ineligible for an interview in wave 1. This provided a sample of 15,127 eligible persons, 13,969 of whom completed the Person Questionnaire.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{48}$ When initially contacting a household, the interviewer had up to six calls to make contact and a further six calls to undertake all of the interviews once contact had been made. If a household had to be put into tracking and was found, the initial call allocation to contact the household was carried over to the next period of the fieldwork. When following up a household, the interviewer had a total of five calls to finalise the household.
    ${ }^{49}$ See Watson and Wooden (2002b) for details of these monitoring methods.

Table 8.10 through to Table 8.20 and Table 8.22 to Table 8.34 show the household outcomes for waves 2 through 23. In these calculations, the households not issued to field are included together with those issued to field. It is also constructive to consider the household outcomes for two groups - those that responded in the previous wave and those that didn't. ${ }^{50}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{50}$ Only responding households in wave 1 were issued in wave 2, so the closest comparison in the household response rate to be made in later waves is for households responding in the previous wave.

A common measure of the re-interviewing success is the attrition rate, calculated as the percentage of respondents in the previous wave that did not provide an interview in the current wave, excluding those that are out-of-scope (that is, those that have died or moved overseas).
The attrition rates recorded in the early waves of the HILDA Survey are slightly higher than surveys such as the British Household Panel Study (BHPS), which achieved attrition rates in waves 2 and 3 of 12.4 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively (after excluding proxy interviews). We believe they compare favourably given the comparative waves of the BHPS were conducted 10 years earlier and it has been generally accepted that response rates to surveys have been falling.
Indeed, the wave 2 and 3 attrition rates for the BHPS Welsh sub-sample were 15.0 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively and those for the BHPS Scottish sub-sample were 12.2 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively (and these figures include proxy interviews which are not permitted in the HILDA Survey).
The attrition rate in the HILDA Survey is noticeably higher than the BHPS in both waves 4, 6 and 7 , but did drop below the BHPS attrition rate in waves 5 and 9 to 18. ${ }^{51}$
In Table 8.35 to Table 8.36 we report a summary of the person-level response from wave 2.
Table 8.37 shows the response rates for the Self-Completion Questionnaire, calculated as the percentage of respondents to which an SCQ could be matched. ${ }^{52}$

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{51}$ BHPS was subsumed into the UKHLS (Understanding Society) after wave 18, therefore comparisons are not made for subsequent waves.
    ${ }^{52}$ The wave 2 SCQ response rate jumped from 89.2 per cent in prior data releases to 93.0 per cent in Release 8. A review of the SCQ processing files in all waves was undertaken in 2009 and this led to the identification of a batch of nearly 500 forms that were not included in the final data file in wave 2. These have now been included from Release 8.

# 8.7. Attrition Bias 

Attrition is generally only a serious concern when it is non-random (that is, when the persons that attrit from the panel have characteristics that are systematically different from those who remain). Table 8.38 provides figures on the percentage of wave 1 respondents who were re-interviewed in wave 23 disaggregated by various sample characteristics. For those persons interested in the balanced panel, the percentage of wave 1 respondents who have been interviewed in every wave is also provided. People who have died or moved overseas are excluded from these figures. These results indicate that the re-interview rate is lowest among people who were:

- relatively young (aged between 15 and 24 years);
- born in a non-English speaking country;
- of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent;
- single;

- unemployed; or
- working in low-skilled occupations.

The variation in attrition over the time is particularly marked with respect to age, country of birth, labour force and occupation.
The disparity in the re-interview rates for wave 1 respondents re-interviewed in wave 23 across the different characteristics is not as great as for those interviewed every wave. The most striking example of this is indigenous status - while only 30.3 per cent of the indigenous respondents in wave 1 have been re-interviewed every wave, 53.1 per cent were re-interviewed in wave 23. This indicates that the groups with low re-interview rates in the balanced panel can continue to be engaged with the study.
Table 8.39 provides figures on the percentage of wave 11 respondents in the Top-Up sample who were re-interviewed in wave 23 disaggregated by various sample characteristics. It is very encouraging to see that retention across the characteristics in the balanced panel are significantly higher than those experienced in the first twelve waves of the Main sample. For example, amongst persons aged 15-19 retention in the first thirteen waves of the Main sample balanced panel was 39.4 per cent, whilst the comparable retention rate for the Top-Up sample was 48.1 per cent. In addition, persons from a nonEnglish speaking country of birth exhibited a 52.2 per cent balanced panel retention rate through waves 11-23 of the Top-Up sample, whilst the corresponding group in the first twelve waves of the Main sample had a balanced panel retention rate of 45.3 per cent.
Overall, attrition is not random. While we can make adjustments for the attrition through the sample weights, these adjustments are only as good as our ability to measure differential attrition. The attrition rates are discussed at length in Watson and Wooden (2004b and 2009).
