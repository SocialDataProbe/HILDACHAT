# 2. OVERVIEW OF THE HILDA SURVEY

The HILDA Survey is a broad social and economic longitudinal survey, with particular attention paid to family and household formation, income and work. As the HILDA Survey has a longitudinal design, most questions are repeated each year. Nevertheless, within each survey wave, scope exists for asking questions on topics that are not covered every year. The major modules included in the HILDA Survey are listed in Table 2.1.

### 2.1. The HILDA Sample and Following Rules: A Summary

The HILDA Survey began with a large national probability sample of Australian households occupying private dwellings. All members of the households that provided at least one interview in wave 1 formed the basis of the panel to be pursued in each subsequent wave. The sample has been gradually extended to include any new household members resulting from changes in the composition of the original households. The sample was replenished in wave 11 with an additional 2,153 households added. In wave 23, an additional 70 households were added.
Continuing Sample Members (CSMs) are defined to include all members of wave 1 households (or wave 11 if part of the Top-Up sample). Any children subsequently born to or adopted by CSMs are also classified as CSMs. Further, all new entrants to a household who have a child with a CSM are converted to CSM status. Further, new household members who have recently arrived in Australia (after 2001 or 2011 following the inclusion of the Top-Up sample) are also converted to CSMs. CSMs remain in the sample indefinitely. All other people who share a household with a CSM in wave 2 or later are considered Temporary Sample Members (TSMs). TSMs are followed for as long as they share a household with a CSM. The variable hhsm on the Master File identifies TSMs whilst splitting the CSMs into two groups: OSMs (original sample members from wave 1,11 or 23) and OPMs (other permanent sample members, i.e. 'new' CSMs).
Figure 2.1 shows an example of how the sample evolved across the first three waves. In wave 1, the sample consisted of 19,914 people. A further 443 births and 32 parents of newborns who were not originally CSMs were added to the sample in waves 2 and 3. A total of 200 deaths were identified across waves 2 and 3, and 257 people moved overseas, though 24 returned after being away for one wave. Of the TSMs joining the sample in wave 2 , a third had moved out by wave 3.
Table 2.2 and Table 2.3 illustrate the evolution of the HILDA Survey sample and response rate patterns over time. For example, in wave 23 there were 8,928 responding households, containing a total of 21,819 persons. Of these enumerated persons, 15,987 people completed interviews and 4,577 were under the age of 15 . The response rate information shows that 52.4 per cent of people who completed interviews as part of the Main sample in wave 1 also completed interviews in wave 23, and that 62.4 per cent of people who completed interviews as part of the Top-Up sample in wave 11 also completed interviews in wave 22 .

Note: 22 TSMs from wave 2 were parents of a CSM birth, and hence in wave 3 they became CSMs themselves.

# 2.2. Questionnaires 

In wave 1, the HILDA Survey comprised four different instruments. These were:

- the Household Form (HF);
- the Household Questionnaire (HQ);
- the Person Questionnaire (PQ); and
- the Self-Completion Questionnaire (SCQ).

In subsequent waves, the PQ was replaced with two instruments:

- the Continuing Person Questionnaire (CPQ), for people who have been interviewed in a previous wave, and
- the New Person Questionnaire (NPQ), for people who have never been interviewed before (which collects family background and personal history information along with the regular content).
In wave 11 and 23 two additional forms were used for the Top-Up sample:
- the Top-Up Household Form (TU-HF). This form included additional questions from the wave 1 HF (including how well English is spoken and external characteristics of the dwelling); and
- the Top-Up New Person Questionnaire (TU-NPQ). In wave 11, the NPQ did not include the employment and education calendar or the wave 11 special topic PQ modules on "retirement" and "intentions and plans". In wave 23, the NPQ did not include the special topic PQ modules on "fertility" and "retirement". New sample members were not asked any modular content until their second interview (this was the approach with the wave 1 sample).

Appendix 1a provides a guide to topics covered in the HILDA Survey across each of the waves. Appendix 1 b provides a list of sources used in constructing survey questions.
The questionnaires can be downloaded from the HILDA website or you can view the questionnaires provided with the data files which have been marked up with the associated variable names (see Section 5.2 for a description of the Marked-Up Questionnaires).

# 2.2.1. Household Form 

The HF is designed to record basic information about the composition of the household immediately after making contact. The HF is the 'master document' used by interviewers to decide who to interview, how to treat joiners and leavers of the household, and to record call information and reasons for non-interview. The date the HF is completed is provided in _hhcomps. The number of interviews completed in the household is given in _hhivws.

### 2.2.2. Household Questionnaire

The HQ collects information about the household rather than about individual household members per se and is only administered to one member of the household. In practice, however, interviewers are encouraged to be flexible. If more than one household member wishes to be present at the interview this is perfectly acceptable. Further, interviewers are given the flexibility to deliver part of this interview to one household member and part to another. Indeed, this is often required, with questions on child care needing to be asked of the primary care giver. The date the HQ is completed is provided in _hhhqivw.
The HQ mainly covers child care arrangements, housing, household spending (up to wave 5 and subsequently from wave 11 onwards) and, when the rotating wealth module is asked (every 4 years from wave 2 onwards), household wealth.

### 2.2.3. Person Questionnaires

The PQs are administered to every member of the household aged 15 years and over. The CPQ is for people who have ever been interviewed before and the NPQ is for those who have never been interviewed before. Parental consent is sought before interviewing persons aged under 18 years who are still living with their parents. _hhpq states which type of interview was applicable and _hgwsli indicates how many weeks have elapsed since the respondent's last interview (if they are completing a CPQ). The date the PQ is completed is provided in _hhidate.
The sections of the PQ are shown in Table 2.4 together with the letter used to identify each section. These will help you locate questions on the questionnaires (for example, if you wanted to find questions on education, look in section C of the wave 1 PQ and section A of the CPQ and NPQ from wave 2 onwards).
The PQ in wave 1 is distinctive from that used in the later waves as it collected biographical data that only needs to be asked once. These questions are spread throughout the survey and include questions about country of birth and language, family background, educational attainment, employment history and marital history. In addition, at later waves further biographical information about visa category for immigrants (wave 4) and parents' education (wave 5) was collected. The NPQ differs from the CPQ in the inclusion of these additional biographical history questions.

# 2.2.4. Self-Completion Questionnaire 

All persons completing a PQ are also asked to complete a SCQ either online or hardcopy. The hardcopy SCQ is collected by the interviewer at a later date or, failing that, is returned by mail. This questionnaire comprises mainly attitudinal questions, many of which cover

topics which respondents may not feel entirely comfortable answering in a face-to-face interview. The date that the SCQ is completed is not collected for waves 1 to 8 but is included from wave 9 onwards (_scdate). The variable _scmatch indicates whether an SCQ has been matched to the PQ. Table 2.5 shows the sections of the SCQ together with the letter used to identify the section.
