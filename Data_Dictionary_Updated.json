      "notes": "The 45 replicate weights are created using the grouped jackknife method. This method breaks the sample into subsamples, called replicates, and weights are created for each replicate of the sample (which exclude approximately 1/45th of the total sample). An estimate of the variance around an estimate is derived from the differences between estimates from the total sample and each replicate. See the HILDA User Manual for further guidance on how to use these replicate weights."

For example, Darwin is classified as outer regional under the Remoteness index but would be classified as major urban or other urban under the Section of State classification due to its population size. Household addresses have been geocoded and assigned a 2001 Census Collection District (CD). Where the address details were not sufficient to geocode exactly, the nearest cross-section or street segment were used. Some fuzzy matching and manual look-up of maps were employed where the street name or suburb did not provide a reasonable match. The Section of State (SOS) and Major Statistical Region (MSR) is assigned based on the CD code. Reference: ABS (2001) Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC), 2001 (ABS Cat.

Standard ABS definitions for relationships and families have been used. If a household is coded as having children under 15, it may also contain dependent students or non-dependent children. If a household is coded as having dependent students, it may also contain nondependent children, but it does not contain children under 15. A couple may be either in a registered marriage or de facto relationship. A lone parent family consists of a parent and a child, though the child cannot have a child or partner of their own. For households where there were two ex-partners and children, the mother and children are considered a lone parent family and the father is considered to be an 'other related' individual. Dependent students are aged 15-24, studying full-time, are not working full time and live in a household with their parent. If the dependent student did not provide PQ data they were assumed to be non-dependent children. Dependent students could not have a child of their own in the household or be part of a couple. Non-dependent children could be any age, but could not have a child of their own in the household or be part of a couple. For households with children under 15 that are not the natural, step, adopted or foster child of anyone in the household (i.e. they do not have a parent in the household), the child forms a relationship with an adult in the household.

      "notes": "Family Tax Benefit Part A is an estimate of the Australian Government Benefit intended to provide income support to low-income families with children or dependent students. FTB-A is calculated based on the applicable income thresholds and taper rates in the corresponding financial year, imputed income, maintenance income, family structure (number of parents; ages of children; dependent student status) and living situation (renting in the private market or not). The benefit is means tested. Provided for each family in the household. References: i) A Guide to Commonwealth Government Payments, Centrelink, Canberra.

Marginal attachment to the labour force is determined by firstly establishing whether a person not in the labour force has a desire to work, and then by whether they have been actively seeking work or are available to start work within a short period of time. Persons who are marginally attached may satisfy some, but not all, of the criteria required to be classified as unemployed. Persons not in the labour force are considered to be marginally attached to the labour force if they: (i) want to work and are actively looking for work but not available to start work in the reference week; or (ii) want to work and are not actively looking for work but are available to start work within four weeks. Persons not in the labour force are not marginally attached if they:(i) do not want to work; or (ii) want to work but are not actively looking for work and are not available to start work within four weeks.
