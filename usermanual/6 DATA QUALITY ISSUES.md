# 6. DATA QUALITY ISSUES

### 6.1. Summary of Data Quality Issues

There are various technical and discussion papers that discuss the data quality issues that we are aware of in the datasets. These papers can be found on the HILDA website. A summary of these data quality issues is provided in Table 6.1. As further research is carried out on a variety of data quality issues, this table will be added to.

| Sample Representativeness |  |  |
| Wave 1 nonresponse | The wave 1 response rate was $66 \%$ and non-respondents were more likely to be living in Sydney, male or unmarried, aged 20 to 24 or $65+$, or born in a non-English speaking country. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.3-8) |
| Attrition | The attrition rates from wave 2 are provided in Table 8.35 and Table 8.36. Attritors are more likely to be living in Sydney and Melbourne; aged 15 to 24 years; single or living in a de facto marriage; born in a non-Englishspeaking country; Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander; living in a flat, unit or apartment; of relatively low levels of education; unemployed; or working in blue-collar or lowskilled occupations. | Watson and Wooden (2006); Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.2-14) |

## Missing data

## Item non-response

General level of item non-response

Missing income data

Missing wealth data

Overall, the level of non-response in the HF, HQ and PQs is generally relatively low - less than 2 per cent. The item non-response rates in the SCQ are higher - averaging around 2.5 to 2.8 per cent.
10-16 per cent of respondents did not provide details for all financial year income components, resulting in 22 to 29 per cent of households with missing financial year income. Analysis of wave 1 data shows that individuals with missing financial year information were more likely to be female; living in Sydney and rural WA; or attach a high importance to their financial situation.
The income data are imputed.
14 per cent of respondents did not provide all person-level wealth details and 20 per cent of households did not provide all household-level wealth details, resulting in 39 per cent of households with missing wealth data (in wave 2) and 29 per cent in wave 6.
The wealth data are imputed.

| Missing expenditure data | The item non-response rate for the expenditure items collected in the HQ is less than 2 per cent. For expenditure components collected in the SCQ from wave 5 onwards, the household-level item non-response is 15-20 per cent (primarily due to SCQs not being returned rather than missing data on a returned SCQ). <br> The household-level expenditure data is imputed. | Sections 4.26.2 and 6.4; Sun (2010) |
| Family background | People living with both parents in wave 1 were not asked the family background questions on the assumption that this could be derived from the parent's interview. However, not all parents responded, or it was impossible to determine what the parent was doing when the respondent was aged 14. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.12-13) |
| Permanently unable to work | 452 respondents were incorrectly coded as 'permanently unable to work' at D21 in the PQ (interviewers were meant to check back to D6, but many used the response at D20 to code D21). As a result, the questions for those not in paid employment were not asked (such as whether looking for work, main activity, whether they would like work, and whether they have retired). <br> Note that the retirement questions were asked in later waves. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.13-14) |
| Transition to CAPI and a new fieldwork provider | An increase in the proportion of 'refused' and 'don't know' responses has been identified. This is due to the combined effect of offering an explicit 'refused' and 'don't know' option for each question and the difficulty of referring to a previous question. | Watson (2010) |
| Incomplete households |  |  |
| Part-responding households | 8 to 10 per cent of households are partially responding (that is, some but not all adults in the household provide an interview). When using derived variables that sum information across individuals in the household (for example, income or wealth variables), there will be more missing data. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p14); |

# Accuracy of the data 

## Questionnaire design issues

| Child care costs | The child care grids in the HQ are very complex and require <br> the parent to split the costs by the type of children (those of <br> school aged and those not yet at school). There is some <br> (small amount of) evidence that some respondents <br> struggled to do this, with the same amount being reported <br> for the two groups of children when the number of children <br> in each group is not the same. | Watson and Wooden <br> (2002a, p15) |

| Current wages and salaries | There are some respondents who reported having current wages and salaries but who: <br> did not report having a job (13 respondents in wave 1). <br> were recorded as an employer (414 respondents in wave 1). <br> There were also some respondents who did not report having current wages and salaries but who: <br> were recorded as an employee of their own business (126 respondents in wave 1). <br> were recorded as an employee ( 16 respondents in wave 1). <br> There may be some circumstances that can explain these apparent discrepancies (for example, a spouse who have income from the family business but who do not actually work in the business). | Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.5-16) |
| Trade union membership | 'Employee associations' were included in the question about trade union membership, resulting in a high rate of positive answers for managers and professionals. This does not match the ABS definition of trade union membership (though this was stated to be the case in our documentation for Release 1-6). | Wooden (2009a) |
| Employment and education calendar | In wave 1, we tried to separate jobs out based on whether they were full- or part-time and asked the interviewers to record job numbers so we can identify jobs changing between part-time and full-time. However, this was not completed by the interviewers very often and was (mistakenly) not entered by the processing team. Interviewers also did not have sufficient instruction on how to treat breaks in employment (such as long-term leave or infrequent hours). <br> The design of the calendar was modified between wave 1 and 2. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p16) |
| Marital status | The HF and PQ in wave 1 asked whether respondents were 'legally' married with the intent of asking about a 'registered' marriage. We suspect some de facto couples reported they were 'legally' married because they have certain legal rights under the Australian legal system. <br> From wave 2, we have revised the questions to talk about 'registered' marriages. As a result, there may be inconsistencies between wave 1 and later waves. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p16) |
| Time use | While we undertake a large amount of checking and editing on the time use questions in the SCQ, it is likely that problems remain. The problem areas are: <br> Excessive hours reported suggest respondents find it difficult to think in terms of hours in a week. <br> The same hours may be recorded against multiple tasks if respondents are doing more than one thing at a time (e.g. looking after children while doing the housework). <br> Some confusion was caused by the layout of the boxes as some respondents tried to record both hours and minutes. <br> The design of the time use question has undergone some revision since wave 1 to try to address these problems, but it is expected that errors still occur. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p17) |

| Moving house | In wave 2, we asked movers when they moved to their current address but did not ask when they left their previous address. For people who move twice in a year, we do not know the exact length of tenure at the former address. The questionnaire was amended in wave 3. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, p30) |
| Duration of de facto relationship | In waves 2 and 3, we asked those completing the NPQ how long their most recent de facto relationship started and how long it lasted. This is inconsistent with wave 1, where we asked about the first such relationship and from wave 4 these questions have been reverted to the original ones. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, p30) |
| Sex | A small number of individuals had their sex corrected in the next wave (in wave 2, 37 people's sex was corrected). <br> Note that the latest sex and date of birth is applied back through the earlier waves. This may lead to some subsequent inconsistencies in the question skips that rely on age or sex. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.25-26) |
| Rental income | From Wave 17, respondents reporting making a zero profit from their investment properties were administered a follow-up question clarifying whether the respondent had in fact made a loss and, if so, the amount of that loss. Approximately half those initially reporting zero profit in fact make a loss. Incomes of some respondents will therefore be overestimated prior to Wave 17. |  |
| CAPI errors |  |  |
| Introduction of CAPI | In wave 9, an error was identified in the data after all the interviews were completed and we were preparing for the data release. <br> The most serious error occurred in the Household Questionnaire resulting in 51 households missing the nonemployment related child care questions and 83 (including the previous 51) missing the child health questions. Two other minor skip problems have also been identified - one involves seven cases at K66 (in the NPQ) and the other three (at A11 in the CPQ). <br> All these cases, the affected questions have been set to Refused/Not stated (-4) in the data. | Watson (2010) |
| Data collection issues |  |  |
| Date of birth | A relatively small number of corrections are applied to a person's date of birth in the next wave. (In wave 2, there were 50 people with a major change to their date of birth and 451 with a minor change. In later years, the number of changes was less and usually to replace dates of birth that were missing for new entrants to the household.) <br> Note that the latest sex and date of birth is applied back through earlier waves. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.25-26) |
| Interviewer observations | Interviewers were required to complete observations of the dwelling and of the PQ interview. Unfortunately, not all interviewers completed this. For example, in wave 1, about $0.1-0.4$ per cent of cases had missing values. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p20) |

| Mode effects and social desirability / acquiescence bias | Differences observed are quite small in absolute terms. Items tested: <br> - difference between reported health in PQ and SCQ in wave 1; <br> - whether responses tempered by presence of other adults during the interview. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.21-22) |
| Working hours | In wave 1, respondents were asked to compare their current hours with those a year ago. 26 cases reported hours a year ago that were inconsistent with their answer of whether they were more or less. The answer to the later was changed to reflect the former. <br> Similarly, a small number of cases (in wave 1, there were 7) were inconsistent with their answer to whether they wanted to work more or less and the number of hours they wanted to work. Generally, the answer to whether they wanted more or less hours was altered. For those with two jobs, some recorded more hours in all jobs that was less than their main job (in wave 1, there were 13). The hours in all jobs were usually set to -6 (implausible value). <br> For those who work at home, some recorded more hours worked at home than in their main job (in wave 1, there were 33). Where this could not be resolved by looking at the hours worked in all jobs for multiple job holders, the hours worked at home were usually set to -6 (implausible value). | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p19) |

| Drugs | This paper discusses the issues with persons reporting using pharmaceuticals for non-medical uses. It has become clear that many respondents are reporting any use of such medications rather than misuse. | Wooden (2018) |
| Wave 20 fieldwork | The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions and social distancing requirements impacted the way in which the fieldwork for wave 20 of the HILDA Survey was undertaken. <br> - Face-to-face interviews were predominantly replaced by telephone interviews. <br> - An alternative interview script was developed for the situations in which the respondent did not have access to the showcards. <br> - An online Self-Completion Questionnaire (SCQ) was developed in addition to the hardcopy form. <br> - The incentive structure was revised from $\$ 40$ per complete individual interview plus a $\$ 40$ household bonus if every eligible household member was interviewed to $\$ 40$ per completed individual interview and $\$ 20$ for returning the SCQ. <br> This paper assesses the impact of these changes on the quality of the data. There is a small reduction ( $1.5 \%$ ) in the re-interview rates of previous wave respondents, which is an excellent outcome given the circumstances. The impact on the response rates of children turning 15 and new entrants is much greater, with a drop of 5 to 12 percentage points. There were actually lower rates of missingness in the SCQ (due to the high uptake of the online SCQ option) but otherwise there was little change observed in the quality of responses. | Watson, Jin, and Summerfield (2021) <br> Watson, Nesa, and Summerfield (2022) |
| Wave 21 fieldwork | While it was initially planned to return to face-to-face interviewing in wave 21, these plans were changed with the escalation of COVID-19 cases in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory just prior to fieldwork commencing. Many of the fieldwork changes implemented in wave 20 were therefore continued in wave 21. <br> This paper focuses on the data quality for wave 21. The aspects of data quality examined in this paper include response rates, response timing, missing data, use of multiitem response options, responses chosen for questions with long response lists, straight lining, rounding, and the length of responses provided at open-ended questions. These data quality measures for wave 21 are typically compared to those for waves 18 to 20. <br> We had a drop-in response rates for those interviewed in the previous wave ( $94.0 \%$ in wave 21 , compared to $95.2 \%$ in wave 20 and over $96 \%$ in waves 18 and 19). The response rates for children turning 15 in wave 21 improved over wave 20 but the response rate for new entrants declined further. | Watson, Nesa, and Summerfield (2022) |

|  | A total of $75.7 \%$ of the individual interviews were completed by telephone in wave 21 (compared to $95.7 \%$ in wave 20 and less than $10 \%$ in earlier waves). The SCQ response rate was the highest it had been since wave 2 with $92.6 \%$ of the PQ respondents completing the SCQ online or via paper. |  |
| Coding issues |  |  |
| Occupation and industry coding | An analysis of the quality of the occupation coding suggests the error rate in the HILDA Survey is approximately double that of the ABS Labour Force Survey. Similar error rates are expected for industry coding. | Watson and Summerfield (2009) |
| Cross-form comparisons |  |  |
| HF and PQ | Few questions are asked more than once. The percentage of cases where the answers differed in wave 1 between HF and PQ: <br> - $10 \%$ for long-term health condition; <br> - $6.1 \%$ for labour force status; <br> - $0.4 \%$ for marital status. <br> Note HF and PQ may be done on different days and answered by different people. Also, the questions were not identically worded. | Watson and Wooden (2002a, p22) |
| Cross-wave inconsistencies |  |  |
| Marital status changes | Respondents are asked whether they changed their marital status since the last wave interviewed. Some report a different status but say there has been no change (for example, there were 258 respondents reporting no changing their marital status since wave 1 but who had a different status). Most of these errors are recall errors but a small number may also be transcription errors by the interviewer. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, p27) |
| Address changes | Address changes can be identified through either a comparison of actual addresses recorded on the HF undertaken by Nielsen or via a question in the PQ. In wave 2 , for example, 119 people indicated in their PQ that they had not changed address, but the address recorded was different and 141 people said they had moved, but the HF address was the same. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, p27) |
| Employment status changes | Respondents are asked to recall whether they were employed or not at the previous interview. In wave 2, for example, 4.6 of those employed in wave 1 did not recall being employed then and 6.8 per cent of those not employed in wave 1 recalled that they were. A very detailed analysis is given in Goode (2007). <br> The majority of mistakes are made by those who change employment states between interviews. Variables significantly associated with making a mistake are being in full-time education, the number of children, the time elapsed between interviews (possibly) and the number of jobs reported in the employment calendar. | Goode (2007); <br> Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.27-28) |

| Calendar matching | There is a two- to six-month overlap (or seam) in the activity calendar collected each wave. Of those who had at least one job in the calendar seam between waves 1 and 2, 19 per cent provided job spell information that was inconsistent. 1.8 per cent matched within 1 month, 0.7 matched within 3 months, 2.1 matched beyond 3 months and 14.8 per cent had at least one job that could not be matched. <br> The transitions at the seam are at least eight times those not at the seam. <br> The spells most subject to inconsistent reports are spells unlike those reported at the current date of interview, short spells, and from respondents with a complex history. <br> Some limited support was found for reduced inconsistent reports when the interview is conducted face-to-face, the interviewer was the same between waves, or they had greater interview experience. The effect that respondent characteristics had on the likelihood of inconsistent reports varied by spell type. Respondents tended to make the same mistakes over time in terms of dropping or adding spells but not in misplacing spells. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.28-29); Watson (2009) <br> Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.24-26) <br> Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.17-21) <br> Note income estimates in Watson and Wooden (2002a, pp.24-26) are not imputed so not a fair comparison. |
| Wealth | Comparison with ABS and RBA suggest the wave 2 HILDA data slightly understates the volume of financial assets, is much closer to the RBA than the ABS for non-financial assets and is much lower ( 20 per cent) on debts than the ABS and RBA estimates. | Watson and Wooden (2004a, pp.22-24) |
| Expenditure | Comparison with ABS Household Expenditure Survey suggests that most of the consumer durables, private health insurance, medical expenses, clothing, motor vehicle fuel, home renovation and holidays are more than 10 per cent different to the HILDA estimates. The other expenditure items measures are more similar. Note that there are major differences in how the expenditure data are collected in the two surveys. This is likely lead to differences in the distributions of the expenditure items, but for many items, the mean value should in principle be the same. | Wilkins and Sun (2010) |
| Height and weight | HILDA compares reasonably well with the ABS National Nutrition Survey, but HILDA has a greater proportion of obese people but also lower item non-response. | Wooden et al. (2008) |
| Kessler-10 | Differences in mode of administration most likely explain differing estimates from HILDA, the ABS National Health Survey and the ABS National Surveys of Mental Health and Wellbeing. | Wooden (2009b) |

| Moving house | HILDA Survey estimates of moving house compare well <br> with the ABS General Social Survey by age group. <br> Estimates are higher than those from the Census and <br> Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset due to differences <br> in collection methodologies. | Watson (2020) |
| Child sample | Comparison with a range of ABS sources for estimates of <br> two child cohorts, aged 0-14 and aged 15-29 in 2016, <br> indicates these groups are reasonably representative of the <br> population. Some differences can be explained by <br> differences in the questions, amount of item non-response, <br> and mode. An area of concern are immigrants arriving after <br> 2011 (when the Top-Up sample was added) as they are <br> underrepresented in the HILDA data. | Watson <br> (forthcoming) |

# 6.2. Missing Income Data 

The percentage of cases with missing income data are provided in Table 6.2. For most income variables, the percentage of missing income falls each wave for the first eight waves. Part of the reason for this decline may be because respondents are becoming more comfortable with the survey. We also observe an increase in the proportion of missingness in wave 9 with the introduction of CAPI, perhaps because it is harder to skip back to earlier questions when the information becomes known (for example, when the respondent later asks their partner). For respondents, the variables with the highest percentage of missing cases (of those with income from the given source) are business income, interest income and investments.

Table 6.3 shows how much of the mean income was imputed for each wave. For example, in wave 8, 5 per cent of total financial year income was imputed in the responding person file, compared to 8 per cent in wave 1 . Including the imputed income totals for nonresponding adults within responding households, the percentage of total financial year income imputed for enumerated persons was 14 per cent in wave 8 , compared to 16 per cent in wave 1.

# 6.3. Missing Wealth Data 

The percentage of cases with missing wealth data are provided in Table 6.4. This table has two columns for each wave to highlight the percentage of respondents who answered the wealth question with a wealth band. ${ }^{37}$ Wealth bands are strictly adhered to in the imputation of any wealth value (that is the imputed value must fall within the reported band) and greatly improve the quality of imputation. Treating cases where a wealth band is available as missing unfairly over represents the scope of the missingness so both situations have been provided. Missing cases for responding person and household-level wealth items are reported as a percentage of non-zero cases and missing cases to more clearly show the extent of the problem. However, not all missing cases required a non-zero impute (most cases do but for some it is unknown if they have the asset or debt and they can receive a zero impute) so the percentages given are a slight overestimation.
For most wealth variables, the percentage of missing wealth falls between wave 2 and wave 6. Part of the reason for the decline may be because respondents are becoming more comfortable with the survey. In some situations, where a wealth band option has been introduced, or an existing wealth band has been continued, there has been an increased percentage of missing values (when counting the wealth band as missing data). For respondents, the variables with the highest percentage of missing cases are superannuation for retirees and those not retired. At the household-level the variables with the largest amount of missingness are those for trust funds, life insurance, business debt and business value. Each of these household-level items are for situations where only a small number of households actually have the asset or debt so the actual number of cases to be imputed is quite small.
When treating wealth band information as a response, nearly 39 per cent of wave 2 households have some component of net worth missing. In subsequent waves this is around 26 to 29 per cent.

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{37}$ A wealth band is two values which the respondent believes their actual value to be within. The bands differ between some variables.

Note: 'Inc. bands' means that for components where a range is asked but the exact amount is unknown, these cases have been included in the count of missing cases; 'excl. bands' means they have not been included in the count of missing cases.

Table 6.6 shows the percentage of cases with missing house value and house debt, both of which have generally declined and become relatively stable over time.
Table 6.5 and Table 6.7 give the weighted mean wealth value (including imputed values) along with what percentage of the mean is attributed to imputed values. For all the household wealth totals presented in Table 6.5, there has been a drop in the percentage imputed between wave 2 and wave 6 . House value (in Table 6.7) showed a general decline in how much of the mean was imputed after wave 2.
Comparing the table of missing values against the weighted means show that despite nearly 45 per cent of households in wave 6 missing some component of net worth only 10.8 per cent of the mean net worth wealth value was contributed by imputation.

# 6.4. Missing Expenditure Data 

The percentage of cases with missing expenditure data is provided Table 6.8. The greater level of missingness for items collected in the SCQ is primarily due to the people responsible for the household expenditure not completing a PQ (and hence also not completing an SCQ) or not returning their SCQ, rather than returning the SCQ with incomplete expenditure data. However, this is gradually improving as SCQ response rates have improved in the latest waves. For the items collected in the HQ, only about 1 to 2 per cent of the households have missing expenditure components. Unlike the income and wealth data, there is no obvious declining trend of missing expenditure observed.
Table 6.9 shows the weighted mean value and what percentage of the mean is attributed to imputed values for some expenditure items. Around 1 per cent of the mean rent payments is imputed compared to 3 to 7 per cent of the mean monthly mortgage repayments. For the expenditure variables collected in the SCQ, the imputed values contributed more to the mean. For example, 12 to 19 per cent of the mean annualised household expenditure on groceries is imputed.
