# 7. THE HILDA SAMPLE

### 7.1. Sample Design

### 7.1.1. Overview

In line with leading panel studies conducted in other countries, the sampling unit is the household, and members of those households will be traced over an indefinite life. The wave 1 sample is then automatically extended over time by following rules (see Section 7.2).

These following rules, in combination with the initial sample that is intended to be representative of all Australian households, provide a mechanism for ensuring that the panel retains its cross-sectional representativeness over time.
While all members of the selected households are defined as members of the sample, individual interviews are only conducted with those aged 15 years and over on the $30^{\text {th }}$ June in the year of the survey. Some limited information about people under 15, however, is collected from an appropriate adult member of the household. ${ }^{38}$

### 7.1.2. Reference Population

The reference population for wave 1 was all members of private dwellings in Australia, with the following exceptions:

- certain diplomatic personnel of overseas governments, customarily excluded from censuses and surveys;
- overseas residents in Australia (that is, persons who had stayed or intended to stay in Australia less than one year);
- members of non-Australian defence forces (and their dependents) stationed in Australia;
- residents of institutions (such as hospitals and other health care institutions, military and police installations, correctional and penal institutions, convents and monasteries) and other non-private dwellings (such as hotels and motels); and
- people living in remote and sparsely populated areas.

Further, to ensure that all members of the in-scope population have the same probability of selection, dwellings that were not primary places of residence (for example, holiday homes) were also excluded.
These coverage rules are broadly in line with those adopted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in the monthly Labour Force Survey supplements. ${ }^{39}$ There are, however, two major differences. First, unlike the ABS, individuals at boarding schools, halls of residence and university colleges were included in the reference population for wave 1. Second, and again in contrast to ABS practice, military personnel who reside in private dwellings are part of the reference population for wave 1.
Note that while all members of the selected households are defined as members of the sample, individual interviews were only conducted with those aged 15 years and over.

[^0]:    ${ }^{38}$ This approach is consistent with the British Household Panel Study (BHPS), with the difference that in the BHPS only people aged 16 years and over are interviewed. The lower age chosen for the HILDA Survey simply reflects our desire to conform to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) standards adopted in the Labour Force Survey.

# 7.1.3. Sampling Units 

The sampling unit is the household defined, following the ABS definition, as 'a group of people who usually reside and eat together'40. Specifically, a household is either:

- A group of two or more related or unrelated people who usually reside in the same dwelling, and who regard themselves as a household and who make common provision for food and other essentials for living; or
- A person living in a dwelling who makes provision for his/her own food and essentials for living, without combining with any other person.
In general, persons who live in more than one household are only treated as members of the household where they spent most of their time. In some cases, there will be uncertainty about what is meant by "usually". It is only in these cases that tenure at the address is taken into account - persons that have not lived, or do not expect to live, in the household for 6 months or more are treated as a "visitor" and not considered part of the household.
Further, and regardless of the above, the following are all defined as usual residents:
- Spouses / partners who consider themselves part of the household but have a job that requires them working away from home for extended periods.
- Persons who usually live in the household but are absent at boarding school or at a university residence.
- Persons who are or have been in hospital and are still considered by other household members as part of their household.
- Persons in nursing homes who are still considered by other household members as part of their household and who have regular contact with members of the original household.


### 7.1.4. Sample Selection

The households were selected using a multi-staged approach. First, a sample of 488 Census Collection Districts (CDs) were selected from across Australia (each of which consists of approximately 200 to 250 households). Second, within each of these CDs, a sample of 22 to 34 dwellings was selected, depending on the expected response and occupancy rates of the area. The selections were made after all dwellings within each of the CDs were fully listed. Finally, within each dwelling, up to three households were selected to be part of the sample (Watson and Wooden (2002b) provides further details of the sampling methodology).
To retain cross-sectional representativeness in the sample an additional 2,153 households were added to the sample as part of a general Top-Up in wave 11. The Top-Up sample was selected using the same methodology as the original HILDA sample. See Watson (2011) for further information.
In wave 23, a second sample replenishment was conducted focusing on adding immigrants to the HILDA Survey. This sample was selected from administrative data from the Department of Home Affairs Settlement Database (SD). Further Immigrant Top-Ups will be conducted in waves 24 and 25.

# 7.2. Following Rules 

The fully and partially responding households in wave 1 form the basis of the indefinite life panel. Members of these households are followed over time and the sample is extended to include:

- any children born to or adopted by members of the selected households;
- new household members resulting from changes in the composition of the original households; and
- new household members that arrived in Australia for the first time after 2001 (or after 2011 following the inclusion of the Top-Up sample).
Continuing Sample Members (CSMs) include all members of wave 1 households (including children). Any children born to or adopted by CSMs are also classified as CSMs. Further, all new entrants to a household who have a child with a CSM and any recent immigrants to Australia (arriving after 2001 or 2011 as mentioned above) are converted to CSM status. ${ }^{41}$ CSMs remain in the sample indefinitely. All other people who share a household with a CSM in wave 2 or later are considered Temporary Sample Members (TSMs).
Where the household has moved, split or moved and split, the interviewers and office staff track the CSMs. The CSMs (along with their new household) are then interviewed, where applicable, at their new address or by phone. ${ }^{42}$ TSMs that split from a household and are no longer part of a household with a CSM are not followed. However, if the TSM is converted to a CSM, then they are followed for interview as any CSM would be.

[^0]:    ${ }^{41}$ The inclusion into the following rules of immigrants arriving in Australia in 2002 or later in the Main Sample occurred in 2009 (for Wave 9). This was subsequently changed in 2016 (for Wave 16) to immigrants arriving in Australian in 2012 or later.
    ${ }^{42}$ Note that if a child CSM moves without any other adult CSMs, they are followed to their new household and the eligible members of that household are then interviewed.
